# BARSReaderGUI

Basic program for reading and exporting data from Nintendo's BARS file format.

## Usage
Select "File" at the top, then "Open..." then select the BARS you wish to read.

You can extract the sound or meta with the two buttons on the bottom right after selecting an asset from the list on the left.

## Compatibility
This has been tested with:
- Super Mario Bros. Wonder
- The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom
- Splatoon 3
- Animal Crossing New Horizons
- Splatoon 2
- Mario Kart 8 Deluxe

The above games definitely work, but any little endian BARS file of version 1.1 or 1.2 should work just fine as well.
